# General Notes so I understand Neural Networks better

## Feedforward Neural Network
- network with no cycles

## Backpropagation Algorithm
- used to train neural networks
- supervised algorithm (input has an expected output associated with it)

## How to use ANNs (with backpropagation)
- figure out what input data to use, specific to what you are trying to determine from ANN
- gather labelled data
- partition data into training set (75%) and validation set (25%)
- look for over-fitting problems (training set accuracy > validation accuracy) -> fix with more diverse training set
